Writing to unknown EEPROMs can break your computer. 

DIMMs contain an EEPROM and if you overwrite it, your computer 
may not boot anymore.

Reading 8bit EEPROM using 16bit addressing may actually WRITE
to the EEPROM. Be careful.

The following chips use 8bit mode:
	24C01
	24C02
	24C04
	24C08
	24C16

Bigger ones use 16bit addressing so you must use -16.

When in doubt, check data sheets.

If you are not sure what you're doing, DO NOT use this tool.
